# Insanes_and_Their_Bus
Android Application for our Smart Bus for Smarter Cities

*Objective: * Our objective is to address each of the common problems that one faces in buses through the use of technology, such that one and all, from rich to poor is motivated to use these public transports and have a wonderful experience. Thus, not only making life easier for people now but also ensuring a better environment for us and our future generations.

Implementation: Our approach is to include the following features in a user-friendly android application:

1. *Tracking of Buses:* Our application tracks all the buses and provides the following information to the users: a) Live tracking and predicted timings of all the buses, b) Fastest and best routes from any source to any destination, live and predicted and c) Important notifications to inform any sudden change in timings due to unpredicted weather and the like. 
            Effect: There is no lack of knowledge or any sort of confusion regarding timings, thus enabling the users to trust the buses and make more accurate plans for their travel, even in unpredicted situations such as heavy rainfall.

2. *Crowd estimation and Seat availability prediction:* Through the use of cameras and Machine Learning and Deep Learning, our users get to know not only the live condition of the bus but also the predictions of the availability of seats at a particular stop, at a particular time, on any particular day. These are based on previously collected data and are also dependent on holidays, weather, peak-times, etc. 
            Effect: The users do not have to wonder whether they would get a seat in the bus, or whether they should prefer the next bus.

3. *Smart Card Payment:* Use of RFIDs for payment which saves the users' time and is also more convenient than regular wallets.
            Effect: No more searching for changes any more and no more regretting for low cash or for forgetting your wallet at home.

4.* Information Audiobook:* An audiobook which works on the current location and gives the user every detail be it historical or be it about an event happening in your nearby locations.
            Effect: Users are never left alone to feel bored and in addition they get valuable information about places they are passing which definitely can be used by them at a later point for visit or for general knowledge.

5. *Networks within buses:* A social network limited only to the bus where the users can disclose information according to their comforts and once they find someone with similar interests, they can use the time to exchange ideas and network.
            Effect: The time of those travelling will not be wasted, instead, it will be utilized for the purpose of exchanging ideas and networking thus it will prove beneficial for them.

6.  *Security:* Installation of cameras and using the same with smart cards allows keeping track of any kind of security issues related to people and their property.
            Effect: People would refrain from any morally unsound behavior, be it theft or eve-teasing. Also, if a crime has happened, it can easily be traced and the culprit can be caught.
Applications of our idea: Most of the features of our application can be integrated in other transports as well. Also it's application is not limited to any location, region, etc.

Final Result: Final result is a smart bus and a smart app for such smart buses.

Building upon the idea after campaign: We'd like to ensure that all the above features are provided and in the most accurate and feasible way. We would keep improving it until we reach near cent percent accuracy, which would also depend on the amount of data collected. Further, integrating the above with Artificial Intelligence will be the next step to make it even more better.
